This is a minimal Rails application illustrating how we maintain scroll when navigating to a "pane" in Hotwired Turbo. Broken behavior is visible with HEAD checked out. To see correct behavior, check out 2e35eab. 

The scroll issue is only visible in a mobile viewport, but in this minimal project, when using Chrome's device toolbar, navigating results in a weird scaling issue. That issue isn't visible when dragging the viewport narrow manually.

Here is a screen capture of correct scrolling behavior: https://youtu.be/QqQispo9abI
