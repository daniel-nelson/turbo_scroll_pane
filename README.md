# README

This is a minimal Rails application illustrating how we maintain scroll when navigating to a "pane" in Hotwired Turbo. Broken behavior is visible with HEAD checked out. To see correct behavior, check out 6c22de2bfaf20942fe4a66addee961cdd1b892a9. 

The scroll issue is only visible in a mobile viewport.

Here is a screen capture of correct scrolling behavior: https://youtu.be/QqQispo9abI
